## Goal
Create a company search application using Spring Boot 3.1.3 or higher.

Expose an endpoint that uses the `TruProxyAPI` to do a company and officer lookup 
via name or registration number.

## Criteria
* The result of the search is returned as JSON
* A request parameter has to be added to decide whether only active companies should be returned
* The officers of each company have to be included in the company details (new field `officers`) 
* Only include officers that are active (`resigned_on` is not present in that case)
* Paging can be ignored
* Please add unit tests and integrations tests, e.g. using WireMock to mock `TruProxyAPI` calls

**Expected Request**

* The name and registration/company number are passed in via body
* The API key is passed in via header `x-api-key`
* If both fields are provided `companyNumber` is used

<pre>
{
    "companyName" : "BBC LIMITED",
    "companyNumber" : "06500244"
}
</pre>

**Expected Response**

* Not all fields that are returned from `TruProxyAPI` are required.
The final JSON should look like this :

<pre>

{
    "total_results": 1,
    "items": [
        {
            "company_number": "06500244",
            "company_type": "ltd",
            "title": "BBC LIMITED",
            "company_status": "active",
            "date_of_creation": "2008-02-11",
            "address": {
                "locality": "Retford",
                "postal_code": "DN22 0AD",
                "premises": "Boswell Cottage Main Street",
                "address_line_1": "North Leverton",
                "country": "England"
            },
            "officers": [
                {
                    "name": "BOXALL, Sarah Victoria",
                    "officer_role": "secretary",
                    "appointed_on": "2008-02-11",
                    "address": {
                        "premises": "5",
                        "locality": "London",
                        "address_line_1": "Cranford Close",
                        "country": "England",
                        "postal_code": "SW20 0DP"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

## Bonus
* Save the companies (by `company_number`) and its officers and addresses in a database 
and return the result from there if the endpoint is called with `companyNumber`.
